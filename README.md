# 🎵 Spotify Dashboard

This is a fun project displaying my spotify stats using [React](https://react.dev/), the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api), and [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions). 

- Every 6 hours, Github actions enables fetching new data from the Spotify API, refreshing the data saved in this repository. 
- The _static_ project is then re-deployed onto github pages, accessible [here](https://citrigos.github.io/spotify-dash/)
